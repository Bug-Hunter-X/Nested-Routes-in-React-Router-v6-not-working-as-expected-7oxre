# React Router v6 Nested Routes Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes in React Router v6.  The problem involves nested routes not rendering correctly, leading to unexpected behavior and blank screens.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code. The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.

## Problem Description

When navigating to nested routes, the child components are not being rendered, even though the routes are defined correctly. This might be caused by incorrect route configuration or interactions with other parts of the application.  The exact symptoms may vary depending on the complexity of the routing setup.

## Solution

The solution typically involves double-checking route paths, ensuring the parent routes are correctly rendering their children, and verifying that there are no conflicting route definitions or missing components.  In this example, a potential mistake is often made in how the nested routes are defined or utilized within parent components. The corrected code is found in `bugSolution.js`.

2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Observe the unexpected behavior in the browser.
6. View the `bugSolution.js` to understand the correction.
